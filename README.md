# Ferrell-Brewing-Control-Software

This is a store for node red flows that are in active development for controlling our brewing system. At Ferrell Brewing Company we have a 100 litre pilot rig we have been brewing on for 2 years and we have just bought a 400l rig that I am building the control panel for.

Hopefully these flows will be useful for you.
